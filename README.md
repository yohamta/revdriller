This game is a simple action puzzle game themed around "Reverse" built with Ebitengine.

As a player, you control a mech-like character armed with a drill, and instead of digging through the ground, you burrow through the ceiling.

If you can break through all the ceilings, you win!

You can't destroy the metal blocks, but when you smash the Reverse item, the special magic power of the drill reverses which blocks can be broken and which cannot. Have fun!
